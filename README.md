# DiscordDiceroller
A self-host (optimally single-server) discord bot with support for its own economy system, RPG system, gambling functionallity, organized poker games with its own seperate cash system and some basic moderation

Go check out https://github.com/samcoppini/Discord-Poker-Bot! The poker functionality is based partly on this, just updated to merge well with v1.0 of the API (and some additional features I missed in it). The code is pretty cool and I'd advice anyone wanting to learn to go read through it.

# Setup
Create a new bot application at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications. Fetch the bot token for use with the "setup.bat" file included in this repository. For information on how to invite a bot to your server, google is your friend.
